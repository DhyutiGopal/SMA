<strong><p>About Us:</p></strong>


<p1>
	<br>Super Math Adventure is a resource for kids to learn in an interactive approach. Teachers can input assignments such games and links to other resources. As we continue to develop our site, we will have a large list of interactive games, quizzes, and online resources for children to learn. <br><br>
	Our learning platform makes it easy for children to play learning games that drive compelling engagement. As we continue to develop, we will have more to offer such as login profiles and live chat box for students to interact with teachers about assigned work. <br><br>
	Super Math Adventure is a free website designed for use in the classroom – whether in person or virtual, allowing young students to participate with others in the classroom. We are all about developing the minds of young children. In life we learn skills through curiosity and play. 
	By combining the two, in a fun and social way, we can unlock the learning potential within all of us, no matter the subject, age or ability.</p1>
